# Java Calculator with Swing and AWT
### This is my first calculator, don't judge it (or judge, it's up to you)!

This is a simple calculator I'm creating just to learn a bit of graphical interface building, OOP, and Java itself. 
This calculator is intended to be able to calculate any of the four basic arithmetic operations between integer and longs.

Optionally, I want to write a code where you can type a polynomial expression and convert this string into a polynomial operation, respecting the order of mathematical operations.
